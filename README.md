# COMP331 Final Project – Data Mining Quality & Bias Analysis
### University of the Fraser Valley  
### Student: Shubham Mali  
### Course: COMP/STAT 331 – Data Quality

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Adult Income Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)** to evaluate data quality issues in the context of data mining. The goal is to identify problems related to missing values, sampling bias, labeling quality, and fairness, and propose improvements using concepts from Week 10–11 of the course.

All analysis was completed in **R**, including missing-value detection, class imbalance calculations, and fairness comparisons across gender and race.

## 🧪 Running the Analysis in R

1. Open R or RStudio  
2. Set your working directory to this project folder  
3. Run the script:

```r
source("scripts/analysis.R")
```

This will:
- Load the Adult dataset  
- Clean missing values  
- Compute quality metrics  
- Generate CSV summaries  
- Print results to the console

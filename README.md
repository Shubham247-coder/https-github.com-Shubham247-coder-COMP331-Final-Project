# COMP331 Final Project – Data Mining Quality & Bias Analysis of the Adult Income Dataset

This repository contains my final project for **COMP/STAT 331 – Data Quality** at the University of the Fraser Valley.

## 📌 Project Title
**Data Mining Quality & Bias Analysis of the Adult Income Dataset**

## 📄 About the Project
This project analyzes the data quality of the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is widely used for predicting whether a person earns more than $50K per year. Because it is common in data mining and machine learning, it is important to understand its limitations and potential biases.

The report focuses on four key areas:
- Missing values and completeness  
- Sampling bias and class imbalance  
- Label issues  
- Fairness across gender and race  

All analysis was performed in **R**, using summary tables and simple checks.
